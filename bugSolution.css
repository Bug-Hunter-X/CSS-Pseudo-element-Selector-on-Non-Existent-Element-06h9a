To solve this, ensure that the element you're targeting with `::before` or `::after` actually exists in your HTML. If the element doesn't exist, the styles will be ignored.  Here is the corrected approach where we add the element to the DOM and then style it. 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>CSS Pseudo-element Fix</title>
<style>
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}

.element {
  position: relative;
}
.element::before {
  content: "This text will show!";
  position: absolute;
  top: -20px;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translateX(-50%);
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div class="container">
  <div class="element"></div>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```
```css
/*This CSS is not needed anymore, as the element is now present in the DOM */
/*.nonexistent-element::before {
  content: "This text won't show!";
}*/
```
