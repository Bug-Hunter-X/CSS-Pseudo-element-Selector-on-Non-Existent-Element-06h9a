The following CSS rule attempts to use a pseudo-element selector `::before` on an element that doesn't exist in the DOM. This results in no visual change and might go unnoticed during development if not explicitly checked.  ```css
.nonexistent-element::before {
  content: "This text won't show!";
}
```
