# CSS Pseudo-element on Non-Existent Element

This repository demonstrates a subtle CSS bug where a pseudo-element selector (`::before` or `::after`) is applied to an element that does not exist in the HTML. This leads to the style rule being silently ignored, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

The `bug.css` file contains the erroneous CSS rule.  The `bugSolution.css` demonstrates the correct way to implement the styling if the element needs to be created.

## Reproducing the Bug
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Observe that the expected text does not appear, indicating that the CSS rule is not working as intended because the target element is absent. 

## Solution
The solution lies in ensuring that the element you are targeting with the pseudo-element actually exists in the HTML structure.  The `bugSolution.css` shows how to fix the problem.  You might need to add the missing element using javascript or change the selector to target an existing element.
